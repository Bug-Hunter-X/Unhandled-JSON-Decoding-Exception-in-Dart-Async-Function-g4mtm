# Unhandled JSON Decoding Exception in Dart Async Function

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with asynchronous operations and JSON decoding. The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request, decodes the JSON response, and then attempts to access a specific key ('name'). If the JSON is malformed or the key is missing, the code throws an exception. The example shows how to handle these exceptions using `try-catch` blocks and re-throwing the exception for higher level handling.

## Bug

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code. The problem is that the code does not handle the cases where the JSON response is invalid or does not contain the expected key.  This can lead to runtime exceptions that crash the application.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code. The solution adds robust error handling using a `try-catch` block. It checks the HTTP status code and the JSON structure before attempting to access the 'name' key.  Appropriate error messages are printed to the console, and the exception is re-thrown to allow for higher-level error handling if required.
